Once started this shows a window with a slider per each screen that can be adjusted to change the brightness.

A tray icon is displayed and can be clicked to bring up the selectors again.

This is done because desktop computers can't easily adjust it like laptops and it can be annoying to use the screen's button to change the settings.
