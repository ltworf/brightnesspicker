brightnesspicker
================

Graphical tool to set the screen brightness on Xorg

A little window with a slider for each screen which can be used to
adjust the brightness of the screens.

This is useful on desktop machines that do not have adjustable brightness like laptops.

It is just a graphical frontend to xrandr.
